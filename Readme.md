# APK-Leatherman
## Android Video uploader

This is made for a very specific use case though I do intend to grow the project over time into a one stop shop for my company to manage our APK workflow without all the extra functionality side quest provides. This is also a good excuse for me to start my first Python project :D


For now the program just uploads a video to a user specified directory on an android device. It also generates meta data based on the title, video description and duration of the video.
